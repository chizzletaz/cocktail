# Cocktail 
This is a cocktail website.

# UX
## **Strategic level**
The website is for people who want to look up how to make cocktails or to get inspiration for making a cocktail.

### **user stories**
**first time users:**  
- As a first time user, I want to navigate easily across the website.  
- As a first time user, I want to search cocktails by name or ingredient. 
- As a user, I want to filter the cocktails by ingredient or category.
- As a user, I want to have clear steps on how to make the cocktail.
- As a user, I want to see what the finished cocktail looks like.
- As a user, I want to get a random cocktail.
- As a user, I want to get information about the ingredients.
- As a user, I want to be able to choose between light and dark mode.

**website owner stories:**
- As a developer I want my users to be able to use my website on all devices.

## **Scope level**
 
**Requirements:**
1. Have a responsive design.
2. A name and ingredient search option. 
3. An ingredient and category filter option.
4. An individual page for each cocktail with clear preparation steps.
5. Display of a preview image of the cocktail. 
6. Option to generate a random cocktail.


**Extra requirements:**  
1. Information about the ingredients.
2. Option to switch between dark and light mode.


## **Structure Level**  
The structure (and later on the wireframes) will already include the extra features. Whether or not they are implemented, will depend on the available time and the difficulty of implementation. 
During the design and development, I worked out the following ideas.

The overall look is kept the same for consistency:   
- The colours are kept the same on each page.
- The buttons are styled in a similar way.

The navigation is kept simple:   
- There are buttons to navigate the site, buttons navigate to other pages like the landing/home page. 

The user is given feedback, in order to enhance a pleasant user experience:  
- This translates to visual feedback during certain actions (like focusing on, clicking on or hovering over buttons or links).

All the information should be easily visible:
- Visual aids are used, like icons and complementary colours.


The website will have 3 pages:  
A landing page, an individual cocktail page and an about page.

Each page will have the same header (with an option to light/dark mode).

**The landing page** will have an option to see the explanation of the game. 
There will be a start button, which opens a link to choose a play mode. There is a link to go to the high scores page. The settings are displayed at the top of the page.

**The individual cocktail page** displays information on the cocktail, like a preview image, ingredients, preparation
steps, etc.

**The about page** will have info on a certain ingredient.

## **Skeleton Level**
As mentioned above, the extra features will also be included in the wireframes. A comparison of the wireframes with the endproduct will show the implemented extra features. Also the implemented extra features will be updated in the ‘Features’ section below.

## **Service Level**
I wanted to keep the overall look minimalistic. The website will probably have a light and a dark mode.
I will create the dark version first and see if I can make a light version.

# **Features**
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.

**Existing Features**
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.
In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

**Features Left to Implement**
- A timer: the questions have to be answered in a certain time, e.g 10 seconds.
- The score is linked to how fast a user answers the question.

## **Technologies used**

**languages used**  
- [HTML5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) for markup  
- [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS) for styling
- [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) for  interactivity

**Frameworks, libraries and programmes used**   
- [Bootstrap 4.5.3](https://getbootstrap.com/) was used for precoded code-snippets, like navigation bar, modals, carousel and to help with the responsiveness of the website.  
- [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for making the wireframes.  	
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) was used version control.  
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for storing and deploying the website.  
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for coding the website(IDE).
- [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts used in the website.  
- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons used on the website.    
- [Chrome Developer Tools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools)
was used to debug and checking/testing the website.

# **Testing**
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.
Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.
For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:
Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.
You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
4. Testing
	The testing writeup should go through your  site with a fine tooth comb and documentclearly everything you have done  to ensure that your site works.Testing is far more than just confirming  that the navigation links work.You also need to consider your sites  responsiveness and browser compatibility.You should go back over the user stories you defined  in the UX section and go through each one,document in detail how your site meets  these pre-identified needs and wants.

Use the HTML an CSS online validators.
Use Chrome Dev Tools: right click -> inspect -> search/select Lighthouse from the top screen.

## **Deployment**

To deploy this website to GitHub, I followed the these steps:

1. Go to GitHub.com and on the left side click on the repository:chizzletaz/MilestoneProject1.
2. In the repository click on the ‘Settings’-tab at the top.
3. Scroll down to ‘GitHub Pages’.
4. Under ‘Source’ you see the word ‘None’ with a dropdown menu: select ‘master branch’.
5. Click ‘Save’, this will give you a URL of the website (see above ‘Source’).

Local Clone:
1. Go to GitHub.com and on the left side click on the repository.
2. Click on the ‘Code’ button.
3. To clone using HTTPS, copy the link that is displayed.
4. Open a terminal in your preferred IDE (e.g. Atom)
5. Use  the ‘git clone’ command and add the link that you copied in step 3.  For Atom: Toggle command palette (cmd-shift-p (macOS) or shift-p (Linux/Windows) and search ‘git clone’: Add the link and 
6. A clone will be created locally.
